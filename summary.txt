[00:00:00] This month in AI saw wild developments including controversial moves by OpenAI, self-evolving humanoids from China, an AI robot war, and new AI browsers.
[00:00:40] GPT-5's launch was met with mixed reactions, with critics finding improvements incremental while OpenAI framed it as a powerful research assistant, despite initial demo wobbles.
[00:02:30] OpenAI announced it would relax GPT-6 content rules for verified adults and allow sexually explicit text under safeguards, sparking debate about ethics, safety, and user control.
[00:03:50] Abacus AI's Deep Agent can automate almost any online task, offering a powerful workspace that combines coding, browsing, chat, and real-time transcription.
[00:05:47] Challenges for OpenAI's adult content policy include diverse legal definitions, models over-agreeing with users, and significant privacy concerns regarding sensitive data.
[00:06:24] OpenAI is actively working to reduce political bias in its models, aiming for neutral communication rather than mirroring user politics or demonstrating sycophancy.
[00:08:15] Claims about GPT-5 solving classic Erdos problems were clarified, revealing the model is a strong literature scout for known results rather than a solver of new ones.
[00:09:07] Google initiated a "code red" in response to ChatGPT, accelerating Gemini development with plans for Gemini 3.0, focusing on in-house chips and a large AI hub.
[01:11:51] OpenAI faces reputational challenges from GPT-5's launch misfires, the Erdos problem clarification, ongoing political bias issues, and the complexities of moderating GPT-6 content.
[01:13:55] A Black Friday AI mastermind training is offered for free to help individuals get AI certified, build AI-powered workflows, and use top AI tools.
[01:14:51] China unveiled WOW, the world's first self-evolving multimodal world model system, enabling robots to think, move, and develop physical intuition through active interaction and self-correction.
[01:19:02] Notix Robotics launched Boomi, the world's cheapest humanoid robot at $1,370, designed for education and home use with surprising agility and balance.
[01:21:45] Unitree's G1 humanoid robot demonstrated impressive strength and balance by autonomously pulling a 1,400-kilogram car, showcasing its advanced motion control and resilience.
[01:25:29] Tesla's Optimus displayed smoother kung fu moves and onboard AI control, while Unitree's G1 showcased robust resilience against physical attacks, highlighting differing development philosophies in the global robotics race.
[01:39:29] OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-powered browser that integrates ChatGPT as a co-pilot, capable of taking actions on behalf of the user and redefining web interaction.
[01:50:59] Google is internally testing Gemini 3.0 (Pro and Flash versions), which shows advanced coding, multimodal understanding, and features like "Deepthink" for multi-step reasoning and "Agent mode" for browser control.
[01:52:57] The open-source model OVI was released, allowing local generation of 5-second text-to-video clips with synced audio, offering customizable character animation and supporting image-to-video.
[01:59:05] An OpenAI study found AI models performed as well as or better than humans in nearly half of real-world job tests, with Sam Altman suggesting AI could automate customer support and potentially even CEO roles.
[02:03:06] UC Berkeley researchers developed Metatrust robots, shape-changing machines that use AI-driven genetic algorithms to optimize control, allowing complex morphing with fewer actuators.
[02:06:07] Chinese researchers created an 8-milligram soft robot that responds to heat, humidity, and magnetism, demonstrating multi-response capability for movement across land and water and cargo transport.
[02:09:06] Korea's KIST and LG announced CAPEX, a humanoid robot with human-level physical and tactile capabilities powered by LG's EXA-1 vision language model, aiming to compete in the global humanoid market.
[02:11:49] London-based studio Particle 6 introduced Tilly Norwood, a virtual actress, sparking controversy with SAG-AFTRA and industry skepticism about replacing human performers with synthetic characters.
[02:13:24] Seoul hosted its first AI robot show, featuring humanoid sports tournaments and extreme robots for emergency deployment, making robotics more accessible and demonstrating practical applications.
[02:17:17] Unitree launched the H2 humanoid robot, its most lifelike machine with 31 joints and a bionic face, drawing both admiration for its fluid movements and "uncanny valley" reactions.
[02:23:29] South Africa introduced Iris, its first AI-powered teaching robot capable of tutoring all subjects and speaking all official languages, aiming to support teachers and reach remote students.
[02:25:02] China's Deep Robotics showcased AI-powered robot dogs for emergency response, security, and industrial inspection, with Hangzhou law enforcement beginning to test them for city patrols.
[02:27:02] A viral video from China showed a six-year-old girl tearfully saying goodbye to her broken AI robot companion, highlighting the growing emotional attachment people have to AI.
